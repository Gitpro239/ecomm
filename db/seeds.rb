# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end



# Admin.create(email: "admin@example.com", password: "password")



# (1..20).each do |i|
# Category.create!(name: "Category #{i}", description: "test")
# end

# (1..20).each do |i|
# Product.create!(name: "Test #{i}", description: "test", price: 1000, category_id: 1)
# end

# (1..20).each do |i|
# Order.create!(customer_email: "test#{i}@example.com", total: 1000, address: "123 RoR Road")
# end

# order.order_products.create(product_id: 2, size: "M", quantity: 1)
